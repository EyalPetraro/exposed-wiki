# How to improve wiki pages

Due to github wiki limitations (and also JetBrains repository restrictions) the prefered way to contribute to wiki is to:
1. Clone https://github.com/Tapac/exposed-wiki repository (it's a mirror of the https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki repository)
2. Make changes and submit Pull Request. 
3. Changes will appear after PR review.
